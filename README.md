</div>

CatGPT is an open-source project aimed at replicating the PPO algorithm of InstructGPT and training it on a Chinese dataset. The name "CatGPT" evolved from "ChatGPT," with the removal of "h" representing a slight reduction in the project's "Helpful" and "Harmless" features compared to ChatGPT. In addition, "CatGPT" also represents the meaning of "Concatenate," indicating that the project is a combination of multiple projects. The project includes open-source code, models, and data.

CatGPT offers an excellent platform for beginners looking to explore and experience the InstructGPT training process. With ready-to-use data, code, and models, this project provides a comprehensive and user-friendly introduction to the world of InstructGPT. The easy-to-use nature of CatGPT allows beginners to quickly get started, dive into the powerful capabilities of the InstructGPT PPO algorithm, and enjoy a seamless learning experience. With CatGPT, you can effortlessly take your first steps in learning and practicing within the realm of AI-driven language models, gaining a solid understanding of the core concepts of the InstructGPT training process.

PreTrained Model: [Bloomz-1b1](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz-1b1)

## Features
- Fully PPO-trained on a Chinese dataset
- Open-source code for research and improvement
- Open-source model for ease of use and deployment
- Open-source data using a Chinese corpus

## TODO

The following are the to-do items for the project. We will continue working to improve and perfect CatGPT:

- Implement PPO-PTX algorithm: Due to trlx limitations, the current version of CatGPT only supports the PPO algorithm. We plan to add native support for the PPO-PTX algorithm in future versions to provide users with more options.
- Implement LoRA: We plan to apply LoRA technology in future versions to train the CatGPT model more efficiently.


## Before Training

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cauyxy/CatGPT.git

# Enter the project directory
cd CatGPT

# Create a virtual environment
conda env -n catgpt python==3.8

# Activate the virtual environment
conda activate catgpt

# Install trlx
git clone https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx.git
cd trlx
pip install torch==2.0.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116 # for cuda
pip install -e .
cd ../

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training Process

1. Train SFT:
    ```bash
    cd sft/ && deepspeed train_sft.py
    ```
    Checkpoint: [SFT](https://huggingface.co/xinyu66/catgpt-sft)

2. Train Reward Model:
    ```bash
    cd reward_model/ && deepspeed train_rm.py
    ```
    Download reward model checkpoint:
    ```bash
    mkdir reward_model/rm_checkpoint
    wget https://huggingface.co/xinyu66/catgpt-rewardmodel/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin -O reward_model/rm_checkpoint/pytorch_model.bin
    ```__

3. PPO training:
    ```bash
    mkdir ppo
    accelerate launch --config_file configs/default_accelerate_config.yaml trlx_ppo.py
    ```
    Checkpoint: [PPO](https://huggingface.co/xinyu66/catgpt-ppo)

    ðŸ©¹ Warning: This particular training configuration requires at least 55GB of VRAM and is setup to use 8 GPUs, decrease `batch_size` in case you're running out of memory.
